A markdown file that lists all members of this organization. Adding your name to this file will let the admins know to grant you member access.

### Steps to follow:
- Fork this repository into your profile
- Clone the forked repo into your local machine
- Make a branch other than the main branch and checkout into that branch
- Add your name following the same convention with your username a link to your profile
- To make sure that the main branch and your branch are synced, checkout to main and run ```git pull```
- Checkout to your branch and run ```git pull```
- Finally run ```git push```
- On GitHub, publish your Pull Request
- Wait for your PR to get merged and for an invite to be the member of the organization :)
